# Azure Static Web Apps application in TypeScript


[Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview) allows you to easily build TypeScript apps in minutes. Use this repo to build and customize a new static site with both a frentend app and a backend API.

This repo is used as a starter for a _very basic_ HTML web application using no front-end frameworks, with a simple API backend, both written in TypeScript.
